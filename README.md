- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a double major in Music Performance!

I am a sophomore at the University of Maryland - College Park, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Horn Performance. I am actively seeking an internship in software development, focusing on full stack, front-end, or back-end roles.

My coursework has provided me with hands-on experience in object-oriented programming and software engineering. I am proficient in Java, JavaScript, and C, and I have developed a custom application using Spotify's Web API to create playlists and retrieve music metadata, enhancing my skills in API integration.

In addition to my technical background, I have valuable customer service experience from working as a Barista at Starbucks and a Cashier at Twin Kiss. These roles have strengthened my communication and teamwork abilities. My experience as an Assistant Accountant has also sharpened my attention to detail and organizational skills.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve problems and create innovative solutions. I look forward to applying my skills and enthusiasm to contribute to dynamic software development projects.
