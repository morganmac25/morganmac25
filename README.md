I am a sophomore at the University of Maryland - College Park, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I have hands-on experience in object-oriented programming and software engineering, with proficiency in Java, JavaScript, and C.

I recently developed a custom application using Spotify's Web API, which enhanced my skills in API integration and data management. My coursework has included projects such as a Sample Submit Server and a Custom Shell, allowing me to apply my knowledge in practical settings.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative solutions and am eager to contribute to collaborative software development projects.
